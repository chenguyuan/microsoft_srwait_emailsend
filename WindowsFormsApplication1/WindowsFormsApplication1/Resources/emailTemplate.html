<p >Hi $USER_NAME$,</p>

$TABLEREPLACE$

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Please take note of the meaning and future possible actions  of the case status:</p>
    <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
        <tr>
            <td width="299">

            <td width="299">
                <p>
                    After the scope the case is automatically in this state.&nbsp; <br />
                    The case should have &quot;Pending CTS&quot; state every time the    next action is on CSS side.
